== SPEECHY

An app inspired by my friend, - a speech language pathologist, - who frequently works with children with autism spectrum disorders.
These children have difficulty in recognizing human emotions, and the app allows to perform training sessions, and record and analyze students' success over time. The app also allows the users to share training data (currently, images only).

Built with: Ruby, Rails 4.1, jQuery, Devise, Paperclip, Bootstrap, Javascript, D3.js.

Available at [Heroku](https://speechy.herokuapp.com).
