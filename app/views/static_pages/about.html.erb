            <p> <b>To create a collection of images: </b></p>
            <ul>
                <li> Upload images representing human emotions. You can make them private (no one else can see them)
                     or public (other users will see them).</li>
                     <br /><p><i>Note:</i> Since other users may use public images for testing sessions, it is necessary to ensure data integrity.
                        For this reason, only an admin is allowed to make any changes to or to delete a public image.
                        Please contact an admin if you want to update your public image.
                     </p>
                <li> Tag each image with appropriate emotions. For example, "happy, cheerful, content". </li>
            </ul>
